    "A spiritist who appears only during the full moon. $B$She claims to have no feelings, but controls the feelings of those around her by manipulating her mask. $B$$B$Often mistaken for a dangerous monster, she's kept away from others but she couldn't care less about it.$B$$B$Some say she never shows her feelings so that no one could ever guess her real thoughts, which makes people feel intimidated.",
    "Very little is written about her, except that she is known as Metamorphoses, a shape-shifter who never leaves a trace. $B$$B$Sometimes she is seen playing with Nocturna and Ella under the moonlight but no one dares to approach them. $B$$B$Though they have different personalities, they get along very well.",
    "No one knows exactly what she is thinking because her blank face can hardly be read. $B$$B$On the contrary, she can see through everything about the person in front of her.$B$$B$\n\"Let me read your soul gently and elegantly.\"",
    "She seems indifferent to everything around but her slight mood changes can be easily sensed by Nocturna. $B$$B$Recently, Nocturna has been obsessed with apples but when she buys apples in the town, people there just run off screaming upon seeing her. $B$Nocturna feels so upset that she brings Metamorphoses along and sneaks into the town to feast in the fruit warehouse many times. $B$$B$Soon, Nocturna has noticed the mood swings of Metamorphoses that she is apparently dissatisfied with this kind of theft. $B$Metamorphoses even wears a fierce-looking mask on the way back but Nocturna could care less because nothing is more important than having tasty apples."
