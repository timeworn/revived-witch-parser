    "A village girl who grew up in the flower fields, Primula replaced her late father as an apothecary, treating the villagers' diseases and ailments. \n\nHowever, she still can't come into her own as an apothecary so she follows Tuonel to study. \n\nShe practices hard every day, learning to identify herbs and making different potions. \n\nIn order to determine the medicinal properties, she once tried to test the potions on herself, which is quite dangerous. \n\nIt took a few days before Tuonel found this and stopped her from doing it again.",
    "She is convinced that she will become an apothecary like her father who alleviated people's ailments. \n\nVillagers give her lots of support and encouragement, which strengthens her determination and confidence.\n\nEach time she goes out to gather herbs, some villagers even cheer for her at the entrance of the village but she seems not good at responding to their enthusiasm.",
    "She often follows Tuonel to the wilderness, learning to recognize herbs. When tired, they lie in the endless flower fields, and envision their future life. \n\nSometimes, she holds Tuonel's hand gently even without noticing it. \n\nShe is very fond of children and often imagines what life would be like after becoming a housewife. Each time she goes to the wilderness, she picks some flowers. The flowers will be twined into garlands and then given to the children in the village.",
    "To be a very capable housewife, she starts the practice of cooking under the guidance of the friendly villagers. However, the shortage of ingredients makes her progress at a slow pace. \n\nPrimula seems quite dissatisfied with the practice so she wants to buy more ingredients in town. \n\nShe has to cross a plain where monsters frequent before reaching the neighboring town, but being alone is quite dangerous there. Despite the grievance, she has no choice but to give up."
