    "She's a young girl born to the Olíndic family from Fomoire Island in the west. Her elder sister Yui is the heir of the family and as such inherited the position of Ovate, taking charge of the \"Anam (Soul)\". \n\nAs a member of the Olíndic family, Miku also possesses the power of the Legendary Beast, yet the uncertainty of this power makes her feel scared and hide behind her sister without talking to anyone for a long time. \n\nTo show her great admiration for her sister, she chooses to wield the same weapon of a spear as her sister does.",
    "In a family of Six Ovates, only one can inherit the position of Ovate. After Yui became the Ovate, Miku has to leave the island to train elsewhere. \n\nThere is no bloody struggle for the position as is common for successors in other families. \n\nMiku wishes her sister well and is determined that one day she will return and guard the land together with Yui.",
    "Unlike her sister who focuses on combat, Miku prefers the art of cooking and can use all kinds of ingredients to concoct delicious dishes. \n\nShe's not conceited about her culinary pursuits, but hopes that her efforts can be recognized by her sister.\n\nThough she's shy with strangers, she still treats all people with thoughtfulness.\n\nShe is concerned about her appearance, said to have been secretly imitating her sister's dressing, though she never admits it.\n\nMiku may appear cute, but her strength can never be underestimated—the bloodline of Olíndic enables her to tear apart hostile intruders with ease by manipulating the Legendary Beast.",
    "Besides her sister, Yothaya is the only friend that Miku can have fun with carefreely.\n\nBoth of them are fond of cooking and often enter the forest to search for all kinds of ingredients.\nThe apples on the tree, the mushrooms in a haystack, everything can be the inspiration to their new dishes.\n\nSince Yothaya is still learning to cook, she often creates some strange dishes that are hard to swallow. However, as her friend, Miku always eats up all of them by pinching her nose."
