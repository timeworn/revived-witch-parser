    "You may expect it to be a male when you read this name. However, this is the name of her sword. $B$$B$She just refuses to give her real name to anyone.",
    "She has closed off her heart very early on and keeps working on her swordsmanship, claiming that revenge is the only thing she lives for.",
    "She used to be the daughter of a local noble family, living a carefree life. $B$$B$However, a gang of bandits broke into her home and plundered her family of everything. $B$$B$\nThe raging fire, the horrible screams, all the images before her eyes were like hell. $B$$B$She was pushed into the storage cabinet by her mother, and huddled her tiny body inside, with the terrified screams stuck in her throat. $B$This poor child could only hold back her grief and let tears soak into her mouth, daring not to make any sound all night. $B$$B$\nNo one in her family has ever survived this massacre, except her.",
    "In order to take revenge, she wandered around, constantly pursuing the trail of the roving bandits. $B$$B$After hearing that those outlaws appeared in the forest, she quit her job as a servant, carried her great sword on the back and set out on a journey of revenge."
