    "The princess of Sunrise Island in the far east.\n\nHer mother is the queen that rules over this land.\n\nHer elegancy can be found in her every move.",
    "Regarded as the successor of the Living God, she has been receiving an elite education from a young age. Study politics, etiquette, and various conjuring.",
    "Every year, she offers a dance at the Kami Festival. Spectators marvel at the softness and elegance of her dance \"Seigaiha.\" \n\nIt is said only the true successor can learn it. \n\nThe dance is like the ripples of a vast ocean, representing the God's grace, omnipresent and boundless. \n\nAs a successor, Talhae will incorporate the people's prayers for peace and blessings for the future into the dance, and offer it to the God who blesses the land.",
    "Although she is a princess envied by all, privately she hates to be confined to the palace. She wishes to go outside to play. \n\nShe often leans on the handrail and wonders, \"What is the outside world like?\" \n\nYet she is not permitted to have much contact with the outside, which makes her very distressed. \n\nWhen her inner distress cannot be solved, she often practices dancing in the courtyard. \n\nAs Talhae starts dancing, all the red leaves fall from her head with the wind, as if they are retreating for knowing they could not compete with her beauty. Whoever sees this scene will be impressed by her otherworldly beauty."
