    "A maiden who does not want to reveal her birth, she is said to be a noble princess from southern Elf Lakeside. \n\nThere is also some speculation that she has elven blood flowing through her veins, which she herself denies. \n\nGifted with the special ability to communicate with animals, she has been fond of seeking various animals in the Forest of Elves since her childhood. \n\nIt's in the Forest that she met the Sacred Beast and the legend says that only a pure-hearted person can obtain the approval of that beast.",
    "She shares the same reverence for nature as the inhabitants of the Forest do, and it's said that the Holy Mother she believes in is Dana, who guards the Forest. \n\nShe is unaccustomed to greeting strangers, allegedly because she grew up in the palace, and she did not communicate much with others except for the maidservants and nobles around her. \n\nHer only friend is Flora, also from the Forest of Elves. The two of them often stroll by the lake together, showing an intimate friendship that no one can get involved in.",
    "The Sacred Beast from the Forest of Elves was the ride of Dana, Goddess of the Lake. He was too proud to get close to humans, let alone be manipulated by them. \n\nHowever, the Sacred Beast before Caledonia is totally different. He seems very close to the human Caledonia and even allows her to touch his unicorn, a symbol of his nobility. \n\nUnder the full moon, Caledonia likes to stroke the plush fur of the Sacred Beast by the lake and quietly snuggle up to him. \n\nSometimes she helps the Beast clean, comb and dry his hair, carefully and patiently.",
    "Caledonia used to be not mindful of her appearance but since she was seen in gorgeous garments and complimented by Flora, she has started to pay heed to her dressing and even tries on the noble garments she rejected before. \n\nThe Sacred Beast has noticed her changes and disapproves of her behavior. \n\nEach time Caledonia is dressed up in finery, the Beast will shake his body by fits, trying to toss off Caledonia to show his discontent."
