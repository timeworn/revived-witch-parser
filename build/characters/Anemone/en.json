    "She is the girl who entered the Chrono Tower with the preacher. She claims to be a champion of justice who repels monsters and evil forces. \n\nShe can switch between the magic of different elements, but her personality may change as well. \n\nShe looks cute and beautiful but once she starts talking, she often annoys others by making some sensational statements, especially with a superior attitude.",
    "She was an ordinary girl from the north. One day she was possessed by the metempsychosis of a priestess and endowed with the power of nature that allowed her to cast all kinds of elemental spells. \n\nYet this power was so strong that she was ostracized and feared by others. \n\nAll those negative emotions had far exceeded what a maiden of her age could bear. \n\nAs more fears crept in, she decided to leave her homeland, away from those who hurt her before.",
    "After leaving the homeland, Anemone attracted the attention of the Holy Church due to her immense power. \n\nThe Church provided a shelter for her and tried to cultivate her into a tool that cleansed the heretics and taboos. \n\nHowever, her personality didn't make her a perfect match for this kind of dull and cruel work. \n\nIn order to force her into that, the Church awakened her fire elemental power inside, which changed her personality by suppressing her weakness and gave rise to a power that far exceeded her magic. \n\nAfter the awakening, Anemone has turned into a whole new person who aggressively performs the order of the Church without any thinking.",
    "Having heard that people are heading to the Tower in search of the Dark Magic, the Church sent Anemone to cleanse those greedy ones. \n\nYet her immense power is also a potential risk for the Church so the Preacher Fellagood is appointed to go with her into the Tower and keep a close watch on her along the way. \n\nAnemone never holds back her dislike to anything she finds annoying so she always has a fight with Dejase who is too reticent for her to get along with. Yet the fight itself is harmless, nothing more than thoughtless bickering.\n\nAnemone has strong self-esteem. Once hurt, she will vent her feelings waywardly, which is a major headache for Fellagood."
