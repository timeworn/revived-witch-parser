    "Kind though she is, Sher doesn't like to interact with others too much. $B$$B$She's not from the Sanctuary but appreciated by the Sanctuary for her powerful magic. $B$$B$That's why as an outsider, she doesn't get rejected by others.",
    "She called herself Sher. It's said she was forced to come here because of her hard fate. $B$$B$Some rumors say she is an arch-sorcerer fleeing from certain sins, while others say she is an elven princess from a decayed kingdom. $B$But there is no definite answer, as she always keeps her distance from others, keeping her past well hidden.",
    "She has stayed in the chapel of the Sanctuary for nearly a century. $B$$B$Witnesses claim that she occasionally speaks to herself in an exotic language, with no intention to be understood by others. $B$$B$She is an old acquaintance with Acheronte, who once revealed that Sher was not her real name. $B$$B$However, even the haughty ruler of the River of the Underworld uses honorifics when mentioning Sher, which shows the nobility of her origins.　$B$$B$\n\"If't be true the one whom I behold up to finally receive the gift of heaven and cleanse the sins of divination, mine own soul may eke grise into the final chapt'r of destiny.\" $B$$B$— Acheronte",
    "It seems she also knows Akasha, Sword Maiden of Shooting Stars, and Dana, Goddess of the Lake. Both of whom are only recorded in the legend, so people speculate that Sher must have also lived for ages. According to Kyphon, Sher used to be the ruler of the Underworld prior to Acheronte. But for some reason, she left there and became the Wanderer of Fate."
