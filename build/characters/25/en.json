    "He is an enforcer from the Sanctuary, as well as the most revered inquisitor. $B$$B$Rumor goes that he is currently wandering all around just to fulfill his vow. $B$$B$\"I used to seek after truth, but now I will serve for justice\".",
    "Some say he is gentle as the breeze in the summer. $B$Some say he is cold as the frost in the winter. $B$$B$However, no one has ever seen any expression on his half-covered face.",
    "He's said to be highly valued by the Protector, and it's due to the order of the Protector that he travels around the world to deal with disputes and eliminate injustice.",
    "He sees his choice as justice. $B$Although he knows that the nobles' exploitation of commoners is unfair, he cannot break the oath he made to the Protector, which causes him great agony."
