    "She used to be a deliverer of the River of the Underworld, just like Kyphon, shouldering the mission of guiding souls to the Underworld. \n\nUnlike Kyphon being slack, Goorveig always actively completed the tasks assigned by Acheronte.",
    "One day, she suddenly disappeared from the Underworld, and even her fellow deliverers were unaware of her whereabouts. \n\nSomeone claimed that Goorveig had been secretly practicing some strange summoning magic. \n\nLiving souls are reaped recently in Chilora. \n\nKyphon is ordered to investigate this incident which might be related to her former companion Goorveig.",
    "When reappearing in front of her old friend, Goorveig looks like a totally different girl who has been through a drastic change in personality. \n\nShe wears a crooked smile and licks her fingers. All the pains and evils have become a source of joy for her.",
    "When Goorveig was still a deliverer, she didn't get along with Kyphon because she was not satisfied with Kyphon's slacking off during the work.\n\nShe complained to Acheronte, the ruler of the Underworld, about it many times but there was no reply. \n\nThen she decided to solve this problem by herself. She made a detection device that gave an alarm to wake up Kyphon once it detected Kyphon was sleeping by the River of the Underworld. \n\nAnyway, the two had a long-running feud with each other so upon hearing that the soul reaping incident in Chrono Tower might be related to Goorveig, the slack Kyphon took the unusual step of volunteering to arrest Goorveig. \n\nIt's more like seeking revenge than being responsible."
