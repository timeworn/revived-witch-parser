    "Though looking cute, she's a descendant of an ancient tribe, about to celebrate her thousandth year. \n\nShe has been traveling around the human world for hundreds of years and thus accumulated much knowledge. \n\nShe usually presents herself as a human, not willing to ruin her cute image. Only when she is very angry will she change back to the appearance of a dragon.",
    "She likes playing pranks and observing the funny reactions humans make afterward. \n\nShe never complies with any human morality, and does things on her spontaneous whims. \n\nDue to her eccentricity, she has no friends but Nocturna and Metamorphoses, both of whom are also quite strange. \n\nThough strange in different ways, the three of them unexpectedly get along very well.",
    "As a dragon, Ella has survived for thousands of years but she hates people mentioning her age. \n\nPerhaps she has grown accustomed to human society and its vanities regarding age.",
    "She used to live a secluded life with her clan. \n\nWhen she told her parents that she wanted to leave the Dragon's Lair to the outside world, her parents were in a rage.\n\n\"The outside is dangerous and humans are malicious. They have done anything to catch all ancient clans including us. We will never approve of your leaving.\"\n\nDespite her parents' repeated warnings, Ella still entered the human world out of curiosity.\n\nThe bustling streets and the flow of people both made her excited. \n\nShe hid her dragon form and changed into a human girl, running to the brand-new world with glee."
