    "She was born in an ordinary village in Sunrise Island and her parents were just peasants. However, she was born with extraordinary psychic power, which made her naturally worshiped as the child of god by the villagers.\n\nFor as long as she can remember, she never felt normal emotions, and everyone around her including her own parents, saw her as a god.\n\nThus she was so convinced of her identity and believed that as a god, she should have no emotions.",
    "As she aged, the reverence people had for her seemed to be a catalyst for her constantly growing power. \n\nGradually, she could use the power of her mind to manipulate all things in the village. \n\nHowever, this power put a huge burden on her body. The girl finally lost control of her psychic power. \n\nThe uncontrolled raw power ruined the whole village where all the villagers with their minds corrupted, gradually died in agony.",
    "The young girl who lost her home collapsed instantly. \n\nShe tried to muddle through by forgetting her past. As her body was getting weak, she thought she didn't have much time left, but after a farewell to the past, maybe a new life could be led. \n\nWith that thought in mind, the girl took a step toward her uncertain future.",
    "After leaving Sunrise Island, Tama felt even weaker and only a little move could bring her discomfort. \n\nThus instead of going out, she preferred to stay home, which resulted in her skin being paler. \n\nA rotten life like this didn't last long. She met a Miko from her homeland who is traveling around the Chilora continent and the Miko suggested that she should set a goal of pursuing the meaning of life and with a goal, the hope would finally be restored.\n\n\nShe felt inspired by the Miko's words and decided to embark on a journey with the Miko. \n\nHer life may come to an end at any time but before that, she just wants to use her tiny power to help others. This may be the meaning of life."
