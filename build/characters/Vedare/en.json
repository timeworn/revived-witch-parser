    "This gorgeous girl is hailed as Rumni's topmost dancer but no one knows her origin. $B$Both nobles and commoners yearn for the slightest glimpse of her dances. When she dances, even butterflies are attracted to flutter around her, which is quite amazing.",
    "Her nobility shows in every gesture. Maybe she was born in a noble family but this is a topic she seems not to be willing to talk about. $B$Once someone mentions that, she will stop talking and leave immediately. Yet, being wilful also constitutes a part of her charm.",
    "Vedare is not only a favorite of the upper class, but also a down-to-earth dancer who graces the city streets, charming passers-by. $B$$B$According to herself, she seems not to like the nobles, but prefers to visit the towns and villages to dance for the common people.",
    "She has an extraordinary passion for dance and a strong desire for the strong. $B$$B$If you were strong enough to win her admiration, she'd be happy to join your team and offer you a beautiful dance of blessing. $B$$B$But before that, you will be challenged to dance with her to test whether you can keep up."
