    "Amorai runs her own clinic in a small town in the Principality of Lunia.$B$$B$According to the townsfolk, every drug she prescribes is made by herself. All sorts of bizarre medical conditions could be cured by her.",
    "Whenever someone tries to engage her in a friendly chat, she swerves off to an irrelevant subject and ends the conversation prematurely.$B$$B$Over time, people talk to her less and less. $B$$B$As a result, even though her medical skills are widely praised across town, her personal life remains little known.",
    "Despite her eccentricities, Amorai is lauded as one of the most talented researchers in Lunia.$B$$B$Her academic accomplishments even made a splash among old scholars. $B$$B$But instead of being distracted by the accolades, Amorai buries herself in the study of medicine and arcane occultism.",
    "There is a rumor in town that Amorai once raised a homeless girl as her own daughter and addressed her lovingly as \"Honey.\"$B$$B$Her assistant disclosed that during that time Amorai pissed her off less often than she usually did. $B$$B$Although the girl verbally protested being called \"Honey\", she did what Amorai told her and went to school in town."
