    "Elis, like the rest of her clan who grew up in the forest, lives in symbiosis with the animals, and learns the necessary skills to hunt.",
    "Elis is a born warrior. The wild power entwined in her genes soon made her stand out as the best hunter in the clan. Later, she was elected chief. \n\nEven feral beasts do not dare to behave in front of her. \n\nEven a fierce tiger becomes as docile as a pet while receiving a simple glare from her.",
    "Elis firmly believes in the law of the jungle, but unlike the rest of the clan, she doesn't try to exterminate all the intruders of the forest. \n\nPerhaps, to the Queen of the Forest, those invaders are just a group of nonentities.",
    "She used to live in the forest with her clan. However, to protect the forest from invasion by the outsiders, Elis and her clan chose to pledge their loyalty to the Protector. \n\nNo one dares to invade the forest ever since."
