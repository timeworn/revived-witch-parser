    "Living on the shore of Elf Lakeside, she often spends her nights quietly bathing in the moonlight by the Lake and praying to Dana, Goddess of the Lake who guarded Elf Lake before.",
    "Dana, who slumbers in the depths of the Elf Lake, sensed her devotion. The Goddess conjured the moonlight on the lake into the form of a dolphin. Then she bestowed on her the dolphin along with the ability to manipulate the moonlight. \n\nIn the moonlight, Mineer could feel the connection with Goddess of the Lake. \n\nWhile the Goddess slumbers, she maintains the peace of the Forest of Elves with her companion, waiting for the Goddess to awaken.",
    "She often plays with Flora by the lake and meanwhile shoulders the responsibility of keeping Flora safe. \n\nAnyone who attempts to approach Flora with ill intentions will be sanctioned by her powerful magic.",
    "Both Mineer and Mayahuel know Dana's romance story with the human male. \n\nUnlike Mayahuel, Mineer seems to know the real reason why the human male finally left Dana. \n\nThus she privately keeps in touch with that man. He delivers the latest news of the outside to her, including some new songs. \n\nMayahuel knows nothing about this and even teaches the songs to Flora. \n\nMineer's elegant manners often lead to an illusion that she has good taste in music, but actually, she is a poor learner in music. \n\nEach time she offers the new song to Mayahuel, she has to clumsily avoid Mayahuel's questions, with an entirely different face from usual. \n\nLuckily Mayahuel is not very suspicious but just curious why Mineer can always discover such great pieces of music."
