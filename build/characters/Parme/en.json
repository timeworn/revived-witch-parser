    "She is a young sorcerer from Andes. After bidding farewell to her master, she travels across the lands in search of the true meaning of magic.",
    "In order to practice her abilities to control magic and meanwhile ward off any troubles along the way, Parme floats her wand behind her, declaring herself a powerful sorcerer.",
    "During her travels, Parme meets many poor people who are unable to change their fate. $B$$B$Born with a kind nature, she gives all her money to them, which leads to her daily struggles with hunger.",
    "She misses the dishes of her hometown, but she is so poor that she can only feed on simple foods. $B$Still, it doesn't seem to bother her. $B$$B$Recently she has started to practice alchemy, in the hope that it can get her fortune and improve her life. $B$$B$However, she is a sorcerer skilled in destructive magic rather than delicate magic, so all the practice of alchemy ends in failure."
