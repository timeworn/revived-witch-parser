    "A festive mood filled the air as Halloween approached.$B$$B$However, the magistrate had been receiving reports of food going missing at night—food people carefully prepared for the upcoming holiday. Some eyewitnesses described a fluffy black thing flashing by. Some said it was an agile girl.$B$$B$As similar complaints kept coming in, the magistrate decided to take action: he put some delicious food on a stall and then hid in the dark to watch.$B$$B$Sure enough, when night fell, that mysterious black figure showed up.",
    "\"There you are, you damn thief!\"$B$$B$The magistrate sneaked up on the target, chest filled with anger, only to find, to his utter surprise, that it was a cute cheerful girl, one with a pair of eye-catching ears.$B$$B$Her feasting was interrupted by the magistrate. She explained that she had no ill intent and that she was only attracted there by the smell of food. After a brief talk with the girl, the magistrate realized she was just an innocent girl clueless about how human society works.$B$$B$So instead of punishing her, he invited her to his home. In no time at all, the cat spirit Betsy became friends with the magistrate's daughter.",
    "Betsy used to live in the woods away from human society like the rest of her kind. When she was little, she heard her parents mention a species called human.$B$$B$\"Those short-eared creatures never listen to reason. And they're very rude, too. They want to catch us and make us their pets. How ridiculous is that? We're the noble cat spirits, for Christ's sake. We have nothing in common with those docile kittens they keep in their homes.\"$B$$B$Her parents' rant only made Betsy curious about humans, planting in her the idea of seeing the human world for herself.",
    "Finally, Betsy's curiosity reached a fever pitch, and in the face of her parents' opposition, she left the woods and ran into the human world—the place she had been longing for.$B$$B$The busy streets, the bustling people—everything looked so refreshing and interesting to the uninitiated eyes of the innocent cat spirit. Excited, she had forgotten her parents' words of caution and was ready to plunge herself into an unknown world."
