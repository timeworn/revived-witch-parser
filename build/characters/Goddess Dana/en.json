    "She's the goddess worshiped by all creatures of Elf Lakeside, and the leader of the High Elves. She led her followers in Elf Lakeside to defend against the invasion of the ancient Demongod Gordia and eventually, with the help of Sword Maiden of Shooting Stars, eliminated the Demongod and saved the world.",
    "In the tales passed through generations in Elf Lakeside, Dana is always portrayed as a high-and-mighty, human-hating elf. Before joining force with a human to destroy Demongod, Dana had a distaste for the human race and cared only about preserving the lineage of elves in which she took pride.",
    "After Demongod was destroyed and peace returned, a young man blundered his way into the Forest of Elves. He seemed to have just escaped from the Sanctuary and was on the run from a group of sorcerers. Mortally wounded, he fell beside Dana, who was taking a walk by the lake. Then the sorcerers came. Annoyed by their intrusion, Dana had them punished.\nShe studied the young man lying on the ground. The sight of his handsome face brought warmth to her cold heart. She had her maids help him up and take him back to the Forest of Elves.",
    "Out of respect for Dana, denizens of the Forest of Elves refrained from booting out the young man. The young man recovers gradually under the care of the maid. His presence offered a refreshing change from the other groveling High Elves—he would tell Dana about things going on in the outside world; sometimes he would even entertain her with funny jokes.\nMoreover, the young man often wrote poetry and songs. His talent was met with great admiration from Dana, who, like the rest of the High Elves, had a taste for music. Even the maids looking after him took a liking to him. Just like that, the cold heart of the long-lived elven goddess began to melt, all because of a wonderful encounter..."
