    "The ruler of the Andes Tribes in the desert. \n\nHer beauty has conquered countless people. \n\nHer hardheaded ability can outmatch any man.",
    "The tribes, once divided, fought over scarce water for many years. \n\nIt is Ushpia who, using her thunderous abilities, led her people to sweep the entire desert and finally unified all the tribes in just a few years. \n\nShe is eventually made ruler of all tribes.",
    "Her enemies describe her as a serpentine beauty, and even spread rumors that she poisoned the former chief of the tribe and usurped power. \n\nHowever, Ushpia herself never responds to these accusations. \n\nHer enemies fear her mastery of witchcraft and poisoning. \n\nAnyone who tries to revolt will fall victim to her.",
    "She was a slave suffering from much hardship in her early childhood. \n\nTherefore she is extremely wary of all people and obsessed with the pursuit of vanity. \n\n\"Submit to me. Offer all thou hast as my belongings.\""
