    "She was an orphan brought up in the Belgica Convent. When she was a child, she was often bullied by others, including the mother superior of the Convent, and could only shed tears alone in a hidden corner. No one was willing to step forward to help her.\n\nThe convent belfry often sent strange sounds into the night, which was feared to be haunted. Therefore, the daily duty of ringing the belfry's bell was assigned to her. \n\nNight by night, she climbs to the top with her lamp to ring the bell alone.",
    "However, people gradually realize that this young girl was no longer the child sobbing in the corner. \n\nAn unholy aura surrounds her so that no one dares to approach. People start spreading rumors that this young girl may have made a pact with the demon in the belfry.",
    "Actually she did but she is not fully obedient to the demon. \n\nShe uses the demon's power stored in the lamp to heal the pain, rather than hurting others.",
    "It turns out that her crying alone at night on the top of the belfry awakened the demon that was sleeping in the darkness. \n\nThe demon reaches out to her and offers its power, the genuineness of which makes her feel warm and secure. \n\nThough she receives the power, she still possesses her self-awareness, not always following the demon's order. \n\nThus the demon inflicts physical misery on her as a punishment, which makes her skin paler, bit by bit. \n\nTo hide her morbid body, she wraps thick bandages around her legs."
