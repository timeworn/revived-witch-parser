    "In a small town in the Principality of Lunia, there is a clinic, unusual but well-reputed. Sally is proud to work there as a nurse.$B$$B$She still remembers the day she recommended herself for the role. Doctor Amorai asked a lot of strange questions, but she took them in stride and answered with ease. $B$$B$\"Just like that, I muddled through the test and got hired. It felt like a dream.\" Sally recalled.",
    "In her early days on the job, Sally found herself insanely busy catering to Doctor Amorai's whims.$B$$B$For example, raise a cat and observe how it reacts to onions; collect nightingale tears and toad slime, and turn them into solids; adopt a human cub and treat her as a daughter...$B$$B$\"Wait, 'human cub' is how Doctor Amorai calls it! It's a human girl, actually. And she's old enough for school now.\" Sally quickly corrected herself.",
    "Sally has a love-hate relationship with her work.$B$$B$At first she thought she would work as a nurse in the clinic, but slowly she realized she was more like Doctor Amorai's assistant. The clinic stopped hiring since she joined, so she handles more work than a typical nurse.$B$$B$\"To be more exact, it's just me and Doctor Amorai. The two of us can handle the day-to-day running of the clinic, yes, but...\" Sally paused in mid-sentence.",
    "Often after a long day at work, Sally goes to a roadside tavern to unwind.$B$$B$Her favorite drink is honey beer—low in alcohol and sweet on the palate.$B$$B$One time, Doctor Amorai forgot Sally's reminder again and let precious medicinal materials go to waste. Sally flew into a rage and didn't calm down until Doctor Amorai promised her a raise. $B$$B$\"I hate to admit it, but she's really generous with me... Ahem, and... the honey beer's really good!\" Sally said with a smile, and there was no more embarrassment on her face.$B$$B$Since Doctor Amorai is pretty tight-lipped about herself, I had to talk to her assistant.$B$——From a resident of the town."
