    "She is the Doll Master from the Elf Lakeside, seemingly maintaining a good relationship with Caledonia, the Cloistered Princess.",
    "She doesn't like contact with outsiders, often buried deep in her house by the lake making new dolls. $B$She can do this for weeks on end.",
    "She firmly believes that her dolls can handle everything for her, not just simple household chores. $B$$B$Under her manipulation, those carefully crafted dolls are able to perform various fine movements, so impressive that people even wonder whether they have been brought to life.",
    "At first, Marina just wanted to create a doll doing chores for her, which in a sense is an idea only slackers would come up with. $B$$B$Among all her creations, Viola is said to be her masterpiece. $B$After its completion, she sent it to a human village in order to test its ability to live independently."
