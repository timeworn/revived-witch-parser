    "As the youngest princess of the Principality of Lunia, Eulalia is the jewel of the Grand Duke but she has never developed an arrogant attitude due to her position. \n\nInstead, she treats people around her gently, regardless of their status. \n\nWhenever she uses her healing magic to help others, her smile always heals more than her magic.",
    "She is a kind princess who is not willing to harm anyone but she's also unexpectedly forthright and sincere. \n\nShe believes that God will always bless the land of Lunia and guide her people out of the suffering of war, and that with God's help, a kingdom where all people live equally can be built one day.",
    "In order to escape from a political marriage, she gave up her noble status, and fled the palace to become a nun dedicated to God. \n\nFrom then on, Eulalia travels the lands just to help the civilians who suffer from wars. \n\nHer compassion has been called the salvation of God, for which the title of Saintess of Lunia was born. \n\nEven trouble-makers like Cynetia can be accepted by her wholeheartedly.",
    "There are times when she reminisces about those old days. Before retiring for the night, she takes out her exquisite garments from the bottom of the box, and with a happy smile on her face, holds them tightly in her arms, losing herself in ages past. \n\nThis scene was once seen by Mortimer, who then started to take Eulalia to the clothing shop. \n\nThe same taste for the cute garments has finally made them inseparable friends."
