    "She is a shy girl, wielding a huge wand that is completely at odds with her petite figure. \n\nShe is not only proficient in common healing magic, but also can use the forbidden magic that's only known by Night Clan. She can cure the wounds that are seemingly incurable for others. \n\nWhen others try to probe into her magic, Tuonel always wriggles out of giving a clear answer.",
    "Tuonel is seen as a disgrace to her family. \n\nHer mother, the youngest daughter of the most powerful family in Chilora, accidentally saved a wounded fallen angel. The two fell in love and gave birth to an illegitimate child—Tuonel. \n\nTuonel was disowned by her family and driven out of the house.",
    "This little abandoned girl wandered alone until she was accepted by the Fallen Angels and eventually fit into the Night Clan. \n\nUnlike the rest of the clansmen, this descendant of a fallen angel never uses life-siphoning magic. \n\nTo others' surprise, she heals all those injured equally, whether human or not.",
    "She is reluctant to talk about her early childhood in Chilora or to reveal why she came to Cassiel. Luckily the villagers in the Lower Domain kindly accept her. \n\nAs an apothecary, she enthusiastically helps the villagers and gradually integrates into their daily life. She is eager to make friends, and Nemesi is currently the top one on her willing-to-be-friends list."
